An ensemble of exercices on JS DOM, separated in 3 ways. 

Here are the instructions;

1. Introduction : 
	
    > - Edit the script.js to
    > - 	 Display the document title in the console
    > - 	 Change the document title to `Modifying the DOM`
    > - 	 Change the background color of the body to hot pink (#FF69B4). If that worked, try with a random color as an extra challenge. (tip: You can use the `rgb()` notation and 3 random-generated numbers between 0 and 255).
    > - 	 Using the children method and a `for ... of loop`, display every children elements of the second child element of your document (display all children elements of the `<body>`

2. Selectors :

    > Without modifying the index.html file open the script.js to do the following tasks:
    > - Add a `title` attribute to every element that has the important class, stating `This is an important item`. Tip: adding a title attribute to an element is different from changing the title of a document.
    > - Select all the img tags and loop through them. If they have no `important` class, turn their display property to `none`
    > - Loop through all the paragraphs and display their content in the console. If the paragraph has a class, display its classname as well
    > - Give each of the paragraph a random text color (different for each one) UNLESS it has a class then leave it as it is.

3. Create : 

	
    > - Modify the script.js to create a new `<section>` with a random background-color for each learner in your group. This section should contain a paragraph with the name of the learner. Those sections should be appended in the `<article>`
    > - If the background is dark the text should be white, if the background is light the text should be black
    > - Find a way so that everytime you load the page the order of the elements changes!
